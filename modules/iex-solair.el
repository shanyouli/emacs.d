;;; Commentary:

;; Highlight the current line of use

;;; Code:

(package! 'solaire-mode t)

;; Enable solaire-mode anywhere it can be enabled
(solaire-global-mode +1)
;; To enable solaire-mode unconditionally for certain modes:
(add-hook 'ediff-prepare-buffer-hook #'solaire-mode)

;; ...if you use auto-revert-mode, this prevents solaire-mode from turning
;; itself off every time Emacs reverts the file
(add-hook 'after-revert-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode)

;; highlight the minibuffer when it is activated:
(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'solaire-mode-in-minibuffer)

;; if the bright and dark background colors are the wrong way around, use this
;; to switch the backgrounds of the `default` and `solaire-default-face` faces.
;; This should be used *after* you load the active theme!
;;
;; NOTE: This is necessary for themes in the doom-themes package!
